# Euclidian Steiner Tree

## Introduction

A set of points can be easily linked together using a minimal spanning tree. Yet it is not optimal in the general setup. Indeed, if we are allowed to add new points, then a smaller tree can be found ; the new tree can be down to 14% smaller. To find such a tree (and the location of the added points) in an euclidian space is to solve the [Euclidian Steiner Tree Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem). 

## This Git

This problem was studied in the context of a research-like problem for my French [CPGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) (preparatory schools to French top university exams) cursus. 
This git offers the code for one exact algorithm and two heuristics solving the problem. 
The code was written in CamlLight. I intend to convert it for OCaml and better use the OO nature of the language.
